     [...]I believe I've found another bug in `sort'.

     $ cat /tmp/sort.in
     a b c 2 d
     pq rs 1 t
     $ textutils-1.15/src/sort -k1.7,1.7 </tmp/sort.in
     a b c 2 d
     pq rs 1 t
     $ /bin/sort -k1.7,1.7 </tmp/sort.in
     pq rs 1 t
     a b c 2 d

     Unix sort produced the answer I expected: sort on the single character
     in column 7.  GNU sort produced different results, because it disagrees
     on the interpretation of the key-end spec "M.N".  Unix sort reads this
     as "skip M-1 fields, then N-1 characters"; but GNU sort wants it to mean
     "skip M-1 fields, then either N-1 characters or the rest of the current
     field, whichever comes first".  This extra clause applies only to
     key-ends, not key-starts.
