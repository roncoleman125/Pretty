/* The only reason to close the standard output *stream* is if
   parse_long_options fails (as it does for --help or --version).
   In any other case, dd uses only the STDOUT_FILENO file descriptor,
   and the "cleanup" function calls "close (STDOUT_FILENO)".
   Closing the file descriptor and then letting the usual atexit-run
   close_stdout function call "fclose (stdout)" would result in a
   harmless failure of the close syscall (with errno EBADF).
   This function serves solely to avoid the unnecessary close_stdout
   call, once parse_long_options has succeeded.
   Meanwhile, we guarantee that the standard error stream is flushed,
   by inlining the last half of close_stdout as needed.  */
