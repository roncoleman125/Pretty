/* Sort the array LINES with NLINES members, using TEMP for temporary space.
   Do this all within one thread.  NLINES must be at least 2.
   If TO_TEMP, put the sorted output into TEMP, and TEMP is as large as LINES.
   Otherwise the sort is in-place and TEMP is half-sized.
   The input and output arrays are in reverse order, and LINES and
   TEMP point just past the end of their respective arrays.

   Use a recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm, in the style
   suggested by Knuth volume 3 (2nd edition), exercise 5.2.4-23.  Use
   the optimization suggested by exercise 5.2.4-10; this requires room
   for only 1.5*N lines, rather than the usual 2*N lines.  Knuth
   writes that this memory optimization was originally published by
   D. A. Bell, Comp J. 1 (1958), 75.  */
